/*
 * Each line structure in the chain is a unit composed of a single "syntactic functor", that is: a symbol, a directive or an instruction.
 * In order to tell apart these very different elements, a so called "role" is attributed to the line; there is one role for each recognized functor.
 *
 * Since a line can only assume a single role, but an assembly statement can indeed have one or more labels per line referring to a directive or
 * instruction, labels are artificially split on multiple lines, maintaining their ordering to ensure semantic equivalence.

 * For every syntactic functor an appropriate structure exists.

 * Because of the limited scope of our code manipulation attempts, we deemed unnecessary to interpret some more refined forms of arguments that
 * may accompany a statement, so we either ignore them by making a byte-by-byte copy to the output structures or we simply let the program state
 * degrade. Unfortunately, we are not the best C programmers out there.
 *
 * On our defence, we can say that complex arithmetic expressions and the like are rarely (maybe never) present in automatically generated assembler
 * sources.
